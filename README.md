# Tarkov_Launcher
This script is made with AutoIt and it purpose is to locate where Tarkov is installed, then it detects the specific file called " BsgLauncher.exe " and it runs it.

When BSGLauncher is loaded the mouse moves to a specific pixel color in order to press play and start the game.

I dont know if BattlEye can detect this script and flag your account as cheater. Use it with your own risk.
